# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter sets the variables of a function while the argument executes the function.

  Researched answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter names the variables in the function while the argument passes and receives the real values.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The method .map() takes arrays as predefined parameters and are required. Indexes are optional.

  Researched answer: The method .map() is required to take a function(), and currentValue. The optional predefined parameters are index, array, and thisValue.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The difference between map and filter is that filter makes a decision about all the items in the array and returns a subset of the array.

  Researched answer: The difference between map and filter is that map takes all the objects and applies the function to them. Filter takes all the objects and runs them through the function and creates a new list.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: The difference between a function and a method is that a function is a reusable code machine and a method is a function that belongs to an object.

  Researched answer: The difference between a function and a method is that a function is a piece of code that is made to perform a specific task and a method is the action done to an object.

  Your answer: To assign a key a pathway through an object.

  Researched answer: An expression that is used to extract data from maps, objects, and arrays and then turns them into new variables.
